# hello-world
test program cause im a scrub

hola this is a test program so it doesn't really matter what im doing here
either way im supposed to be doing my homework right now so like
probably not a good idea to make this too long

well I just realized this doesn't even have to be program lol im bad
anyways perhaps I should actually start working on something cool with git
but idk I have no ideas
my friend has this cool animation project we're trying to do but it's too time consuming to do right now
agh might as well start doing homework again or something

sighh I wish I had more time to code

you know what screw it i'm just gonna make hello world programs in every language I know
